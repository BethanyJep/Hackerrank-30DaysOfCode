    "These allow you to perform certain operations on your data. There are 3 basic types:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Unary: operates on 1 operand\n",
    "    Binary: operates on 2 operands\n",
    "    Ternary: operates on 3 operands\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic Operators\n",
    "The binary operators used for arithmetic are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    +: Additive\n",
    "    -: Subtraction\n",
    "    *: Multiplication\n",
    "    /: Division\n",
    "    %: Remainder (modulo)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "    +: A binary operator used for String concatenation\n",
    "    ++: This unary operator is used to preincrement (increment by 1 before use) when prepended to a variable name or postincrement (increment by 1 after use) when appended to a variable.\n",
    "    --: This unary operator is used to predecrement (decrement by 1 before use) when prepended to a variable name or postdecrement (decrement by 1 after use) when appended to a variable.\n",
    "    !: This unary operator means not (negation). It's used before a variable or logical expression that evaluates to true or false.\n",
    "    ==: This binary operator is used to check the equality of 2 primitives.\n",
    "    !=: This binary operator is used to check the inequality of 2 primitives.\n",
    "    <, >, <=, >=: These are the respective binary operators for less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, and are used to compare two operands.\n",
    "    &&, ||: These are the respective binary operators used to perform logical AND and logical OR operations on two boolean (i.e.: true or false) statements.\n",
    "    ? : This ternary operator is used for simple conditional statements (i.e.: if ? then : else).\n"
